### Landing page notice

We offer a free landing page template that you can use as a starter and deploy it to Netlify. You can use this landing page or create your own custom one. We do not offer support for this part. The design of your website is your own responsibility!

### :vertical_traffic_light: Deploy your site

    - Connect to GitHub - **log in** with you GitHub account
    - Configure your site - change the repository name if you want
    - Ensure that the build command is set, navigate to **Site Settings** than **Build & Deploy**, on the right **Biuld command** should be **gatsby build** and **Publish directory** should be **public/**. If you make this changes navigate to **Deploys** and click on **Trigger deploy**
    - wait until your site is deployed
    - click **Set up a custom domain**

- any change you commit on GitHub after you deploy your site for the first time will trigger a build on Netlify and your site will be updated automatically


## Customize your site

### :star2: Change site logo and hero image
- the site logo has two versions: light (used on site enter, when the background is darker) and dark (used when the navigation bar is white - on scroll or on small devices)
    - to change the light version, save your logo to `src/images/logo600x332light.png`
    - to change the dark version, save your logo to `src/images/logo600x332dark.png`
    - keep in mind that you can use the same logo - but you must be sure that is looks ok on the both cases
    - for the best fit, try to use logos with the same size: *600x332*
- for hero image (the image that appears on the first section of the site, on the background, save the new image in `src/images/hero.png`.
    - for the best result, try to use an image with almost the same size as the original one (*1645x1398*) and transparent background.
- you can also change the favicon from `src/images/icon.png` - this is also used on mobile phones as an icon.
    - make sure that the image is big enough and square formatted, so that the quality is good everywhere.
- for footer image (the image that appears on the bottom of the page, replace the next new image from `src/images/footer.png`.
    - for the best result, try to use an image with almost the same size as the original one (*350x150*).
